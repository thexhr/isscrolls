.Sh NAME
.Nm isscrolls
.Nd Player toolkit for the Ironsworn Family Tabletop RPG
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm isscrolls
.Op Fl bcx
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a toolkit for players of the Ironsworn tabletop RPG.
It supports classic Ironsworn, Delve, Starforged and Sundered Isles.
It is intended for both solo and co-op play and allows tracking your
character's progress including vows, roll on adventure and exploration moves,
tracks progress for fights, journeys, and expeditions and provides results
from the static oracle tables from the official rulebook.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Suppress the banner on startup.
.It Fl c
Enable colors and additional characters to beautify output.
Recommended if you don't use a screen reader or a braille terminal.
.It Fl x
Roll a
.Dq cursed die
alongside the other dice.
This is a speciality of the
.Em Sundered Isles
expansion, however, it can be used for the other games as well.
.El
.Sh HOW TO USE
.Nm
basically works like a
.Ux
shell.
Commands can be entered and will show their output.
Certain commands need an argument in order to run properly, other commands
might support optional arguments.
Once a character is loaded, the prompt will change and display the
character's name.
The
.Ic help
command will show an overview of all available commands.
.Pp
.Nm
is linked against
.Xr readline 3 ,
thus any shortcut or character combination that work with a common
.Ux
shell also work for the built-in shell.
.Ss Information for general Gameplay
.Nm
supports all games of the Ironsworn family and allows players to freely
use moves or actions from all of them.
Therefore, depending on the game you own you might see statistics or
information that belong to another game, e.g., characters get experience
points in classic Ironsworn for fulfilling vows while in Starforged they
get experience via the so called
.Em legacy track .
Both ways are supported by
.Nm
so choose the one that fits your game the most.
.Pp
Sometimes
.Nm
cannot take a decision for you and refers you to the official rulebook.
In these cases choose the outcome most suitable for your character and
manipulate the stats with the
.Ic increase ,
.Ic decrease
or
.Ic toogle
commands.
See the section below for more information how the commands work.
.Ss Character Display
.Nm
is best used if you generate a character with the
.Ic create
command and load it afterward with the
.Ic cd
command.
Once you load a character, their current stats will be printed which looks
similar to the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Name: Erin Kalina (Exp: 7/30) Exp spent: 4

Edge: 4 Heart: 3 Iron: 2 Shadow: 2 Wits: 3

Momentum: 10/10 [2] Health: 4/5 Spirit: 5/5 Supply: 3/5

Wounded:        0 Unprepared:   0 Encumbered:   0 Shaken:       0
Corrupted:      0 Tormented:    0 Cursed:       0 Maimed:       1

Bonds: 0.00 (L: 0) Quests: 0.00 (L: 0) Discoveries: 0.00 (L: 0)
.Ed
.Pp
The first line shows the character's name, their experience points, the
amount of experience points spent to acquire new resources or improve
existing ones and their failure track in ticks in case the character has rolled
more than one miss.
.Pp
The second line shows the character's stats and the third one the current
values.
The number in the square brackets after
.Em Momentum
is the reset momentum.
.Pp
Debilities are shown in the next two lines, a 0 means that the character
does not suffer from this particular debility while a 1 means that they
suffer from it.
.Pp
The last line shows the character's progress for bonds, quests and,
discoveries including the progress on the legacy tracks.
.Ss Vows, Expeditions, Journeys, Fights and Delve
As soon as a character starts one of them, the prompt changes and
displays the current undertaking and the current progress.
.Pp
Progress will be tracked automatically according to the rank.
For lower ranks (Troublesome - Formidable),
progress will be shown as absolute numbers, e.g. a 2 represents
two boxes.
For higher ranks (Extreme and Epic), progress will be shown as decimal
numbers and 0.25 represents one tick,
e.g. 0.75 means that the character already made 3 ticks progress.
Since
.Em Ironsworn's
progress bar is always 10 boxes, only the current progress is shown.
.Pp
In case the rulebook gives you more options, you always have the possibility
to manually mark progress with the
.Ic markprogress
command.
In case you have an active vow, its title and description will be shown.
.Ss Notes and Journaling
It is possible to create notes for future reference.
.Pp
It is also able to write entries to a journal file.
.Pp
.Em Autojournalling
can be turned on to automatically journal some commands and their results,
such as the results of random actions.
